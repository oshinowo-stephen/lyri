A simple bot that just plays music! Originally and still is something I made for myself to play ambience, soundtracks, and combat music for my D&D sessions.

### Contributing

[Pull Requests]() & [Issues]() are a great way to ~~do work~~ handle things for me! Most would be most appreciated!!! If you cannot provide that type of support simply coming my [Discord]() and describing an bug, error, or any glitch with the bot would be also apprecaited!

And if you're feeling generous in anyway and wanna support the small indie companies, you can always [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/whoastonic). No seriously anything can help get this off the ground would be great help...
